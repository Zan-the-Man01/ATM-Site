                About the Association
            </h1>

            <p>
                Association of Technology in Medicine (ATM) is a Registered
                Student Organization at the University of Illinois at
                Urbana-Champaign that looks to provide ambitious students in
                the fields of engineering and the medical sciences with
                opportunities and invaluable learning experiences. The ATM will
                hold discussions on the vast and converging fields of medicine
                and technology, and will also host guests to provide insight
                into the diverse array of topics. We also try to give back to
                the community and do our best to provide members with the
                chance to do so as well.
            </p>

                Projects and Interests
            </h1>

            <p>
                The ATM is always looking for new and inovative technologies
                to study and learn about. These topics of interest can range
                anywhere from exciting medical or treatment studies to cutting
                edge pieces of tech or software. A few recent examples that
                have been discussed are the breakthrough Covid-19 vaccine by
                Pfizer, and the unbelievably lifelike SPOT robots by Boston
                Dynamics.
